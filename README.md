# MkDocs Demo

This repository is for learning how to set up a documentation website using Mkdocs.
I'll be using [Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme for this.

## Steps to run locally

1) Create a python virtual environment

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```

1) Activate the virtual environment

    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

1) Install dependancies.

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

1) Spin up a dev server.

    ```bash
    mkdocs serve
    ```

1) Your docs are served on <http://localhost:8000>.
